# Causal-Auditing-of-Latent-Affect-in-Language-Models-via-Activation-Steering
Mechanistic interpretability study on GPT-2 using TransformerLens. Implements inference-time activation steering on the residual stream (Layer 8) to causally modulate latent affect ("anger") and validates findings against norm-matched control vectors.
